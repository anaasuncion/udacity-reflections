When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  A remote repository would be helpful when you want to collaborate with others and/or when
  you want to work on a project from various computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Having the freedom to choose when pulls are done allow for more freedom for the contributor.
  Manually also allows for a team of contributor decide when is the best time to push/pull changes
  that best fit the needs of the contributors and the project.
