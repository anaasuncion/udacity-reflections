When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  A remote repository would be helpful when you want to collaborate with others and/or when
  you want to work on a project from various computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Having the freedom to choose when pulls are done allow for more freedom for the contributor.
  Manually also allows for a team of contributor decide when is the best time to push/pull changes
  that best fit the needs of the contributors and the project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Forks are a way to copy someone else's repository to your own GitHub account.
  Clones are copys of a repository from a local device to another local device or from GitHub to a local device.
  Branches are a unique set of commits with a unique name when it diverges from the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  You would be able to check differences between your changes and the last known state of the remote.
