What happens when you initialize a repository? 
Why do you need to do it?
    It create meta data that begins to track that it is a repository with .git file
    We need it so that moving forward we can commit and save different versions.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
    Staging is different from working in that it's an inbetween state to the git repo. 
    The staging area lets you decide what you want to officially commit before creating
    the commit. 
    It's valuable in that you can design and decide what goes into a commit before doing
    the commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
    Staging area and diff --staged lets you double check what is different between what you plan 
    to commit and what is alreay in a commit. That way you check what you will commit is what
    you actually want to commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
    It helps when you're trying out an experimental feature and still saving a working version. 
    Using a branch to create an easier version of a game would be helpful and so you have a regular (master) branch
    and an easy one.
